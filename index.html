<h2>Author: Riona Kelly<br>Email: C00296706@setu.ie<br><br>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to my Interaction Design project. I am going to talk about gamifying learning apps. Our aim is to make learning more fun for people to keep them engaged and draw more people into the app.</p>
<p>Gamification is the act of applying game design principles to non-games, such as for education. The purpose of this is to make the application more engaging and enjoyable to interact with.</p>
<p>This project will involve multiple sections, including a competitive analysis, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing.</p>
<p>The competitive audit will allow me to see strengths and weaknesses of existing educational apps and find out what I should and shouldn't do.</p>
<p>Wireframing and prototypinh will let me design and evelop the interface of the app and see how a user would interact with it.</p>
<p>Usability testing will then be conducted to gather feedback from people who have used the app and this feedback will be used to refind the app and make it better.</p>
<p>Overall my goal is to create a learning app that will not only educates users but be fun to use.</p>
