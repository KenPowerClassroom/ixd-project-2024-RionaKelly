<h1>IxD Project 2023</h1>
<h2>Author: Riona Kelly<br>Email: C00296706@setu.ie<br><br>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to my Interaction Design project. I am going to talk about gamifying learning apps. Our aim is to make learning more fun for people to keep them engaged and draw more people into the app.<br>
Gamification is the act of applying game design principles to non-games, such as for education. The purpose of this is to make the application more engaging and enjoyable to interact with.<br>
This project will involve multiple sections, including a competitive analysis, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing.<br>
The competitive audit will allow me to see strengths and weaknesses of existing educational apps and find out what I should and shouldn't do.<br>
Wireframing and prototypinh will let me design and evelop the interface of the app and see how a user would interact with it.<br>
Usability testing will then be conducted to gather feedback from people who have used the app and this feedback will be used to refind the app and make it better.<br>
Overall my goal is to create a learning app that will not only educates users but be fun to use.</p>
